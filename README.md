# This repository won't be develop further

This software is developed as a project for the Software Engineering Principle (SEP) class. We have since closed that chapter of our lives. As a result, the project won't be developed further. That being said, despite us all having questionable feeling regarding the SEP class itself we are quite proud of what we archeive. We hope all visistor enjoy what you see in these repository and maybe even bring it to good use.
